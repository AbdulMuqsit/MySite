            <h3>Full-Stack Web Development</h3>
            <p class="code-skill-description">I have the skills to design, develop, and maintain all aspects of a web application. From creating the user interface that people see and interact with to building the server-side logic that powers the application and the database that stores its data, I'm able to handle every part of the development process.I've honed my skills in several programming languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and SQL. I have a deep understanding of web development principles and am comfortable working on both the frontend and backend of an application.

              As a full stack developer, I'm also a problem solver. I enjoy thinking creatively and coming up with solutions to complex problems, and I'm able to communicate effectively with clients, project managers, and other members of a development team.</p>

            <h3>Data Structures</h3>
            <p class="chilli-skill-description">Data structures are like containers that hold and organize data in a way that makes it easy to retrieve and manipulate.

              As a software developer, I've studied and worked extensively with a wide range of data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. I understand the strengths and weaknesses of each data structure and how to choose the right one for a specific task.
              
              By using efficient data structures, I can create algorithms and programs that perform quickly and can handle large amounts of data. This is particularly important when working with large-scale applications, such as those used in finance, healthcare, and e-commerce.
              
              In addition to understanding data structures, I'm also skilled in programming languages such as Java, C++, and Python. This allows me to implement these data structures and algorithms effectively in my code.
              
              Overall, my knowledge and skills in data structures enable me to create high-performing software applications that meet the needs of businesses and organizations."</p>
